Correlation and covariance

 

 

 

1.      Load the dataset (iris dataset)

2.       Find the correlation matrix

3.      Plot the correlation plot on Dataset and visualize giving an overview of relationships among data on iris data.

Analysis:

 

1.      How does the color scale indicate the strength and direction of the correlation between variables?

2.      Why are the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix always 1?

3.      Choose a pair of variables with a strong positive correlation. What does this correlation suggest about the relationship between those variables?

4.      Choose a pair of variables with a strong negative correlation. What does this correlation suggest about the relationship between those variables?

5.      Identify a pair of variables with a light or neutral color in the plot. What does this color indicate about the correlation between those variables?

6.      Based on the correlation plot, are there any pairs of variables that might indicate multicollinearity?
