Introduction to Machine Learning with R

 


1.     Install and load necessary packages  (caret, e1071)

2.     Load iris dataset

3.     Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets

4.     Build a SVM model

5.     Make predictions on the test set

6.     Evaluate the model by displaying confusion matrix

7.     Print the accuracy for test set 20%, 40% and 50 % also

8.     Provide your split ratio recommendation with justification.

Question:

9.     Define model accuracy and provide the formula for calculating it.

10. Define sensitivity and specificity along with their respective formulas.
