1.1  Create a numeric vector named "grades" containing the scores of five students: 85, 92, 78, 95, and 88. Calculate the average (mean) of the grades using the appropriate function. Display the contents of the "grades" vector.

 

# Creating a numeric vector named "grades"

grades = c(85, 92, 78, 95, 88)

 

# Calculating the average (mean) of grades

average_grade <- mean(grades)

average_grade

 

# Displaying the contents of the "grades" vector

grades

 

# Accessing the third grade using indexing

third_grade <- grades[3]

third_grade

 

1.2 Creating Vectors:

 

Create a numeric vector named "ages" with the ages of five individuals: 22, 30, 25, 19, and 28. Create a character vector named "names" with the names of the same individuals. Display both the vectors.

 

1.3 Performing Arithmetic Operations:

 

Create a numeric vector called "prices" with the prices of four products: 10.99, 24.75, 5.50, and 8.25. Calculate the total cost of purchasing two units of each product and store it in a new vector.

1.4 Creating and Manipulating Vectors:

 

·        Create a numeric vector named "temperatures" containing the temperatures of a city for a week (e.g., 75, 78, 82, ...).

·        Calculate the maximum and minimum temperatures using the appropriate functions.

·        Calculate the average temperature and the temperature standard deviation.

·        Display the temperatures in Celsius by subtracting 32 and multiplying by 5/9.

 

1.5 Vectorized Operations:

 

·        Create two numeric vectors "sales" and "expenses" containing monthly sales and expenses data.

·        Calculate the monthly profit by subtracting expenses from sales.

·        Calculate the yearly profit by summing the monthly profits.

·        Find the months with profits greater than 10000 and display their indices.

 

 

Using Without R Objects on Console

 

1.6 Without using a vector, calculate the sum of the same five student scores. Calculate the average of the scores without using the mean function. Display the sum and average calculated directly.

 

# Calculating the sum of student scores without using a vector

sum_of_scores  = 85 + 92 + 78 + 95 + 88

sum_of_scores

 

# Calculating the average without using the mean function

average_without_vector = sum_of_scores / 5

average_without_vector

 

 

1.7Calculate the simple interest for a principal of 1000, rate of 5%, and time of 2 years.

1.8Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle with length 8 units and width 5 units.

1.9Calculate the area of a triangle with base 10 units and height 6 units.

1.10   	Convert 60 inches to feet.

1.11   	Solve the equation 2x+5=17 for given x

install.packages("pracma")

library(pracma)

#Solve the equation 2x + 5 = 17 for x



equation <- function(x) {

  result <- 2*x + 5 - 17

  return(result)

}


# Use uniroot to find the root (solution)

solution <- uniroot(equation, interval = c(-100, 100))


# Print the solution

cat("The solution for x is:", solution$root, "\n")


1.12   	Calculate the volume of a cylinder with radius 5 units and height 10 units.

 

 

2.     Using mathematical functions on console

 

 

2.1  Calculate the natural logarithm (base e) of 10.

2.2  Calculate the absolute value of -7.

2.3  Round 3.75 to the nearest integer.

2.4  Calculate the square root of 25.

2.5  Generate a random integer between 1 and 10.

 

 

3.     Write an R script, to create R objects for calculator

 

# Define a function for addition

add <- function(a, b) {

  result <- a + b

  return(result)

}

 

# Define a function for subtraction

subtract <- function(a, b) {

  result <- a - b

  return(result)

}

 

# Define a function for multiplication

multiply <- function(a, b) {

  result <- a * b

  return(result)

}

 

# Define a function for division

divide <- function(a, b) {

  if (b == 0) {

	return("Cannot divide by zero!")

  }

  result <- a / b

  return(result)

}

 

# Test the calculator functions

num1 <- 10

num2 <- 5

 

add_result <- add(num1, num2)

print(paste("Addition:", num1, "+", num2, "=", add_result))

 

subtract_result <- subtract(num1, num2)

print(paste("Subtraction:", num1, "-", num2, "=", subtract_result))
