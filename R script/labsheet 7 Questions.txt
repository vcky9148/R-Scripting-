Basic Statistics with R

 

 

Dataset: Sales_data.csv

 

 

1.      Load the dataset

2.      Calculate the mean (average) of the 'price,' 'quantity,' and 'revenue' columns separately to understand the central tendency of these variables.

3.      Calculate the median (middle value) of the 'price,' 'quantity,' and 'revenue' columns to understand the data's distribution.

4.      Compute the variance of 'price,' 'quantity,' and 'revenue' to measure the spread or dispersion of these variables. A higher variance indicates more significant variability.

5.      Calculate the standard deviation of 'price,' 'quantity,' and 'revenue' to quantify the extent of data dispersion around the mean.

6.      Generate summary statistics for each numerical column, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.

7.      Explore Date Information: If 'date' is in a date format, calculate the earliest and latest date in the dataset to understand the date range covered by the data.

8.      Correlation Analysis: Compute correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson's correlation) between 'price,' 'quantity,' and 'revenue' to identify any relationships or dependencies between these variables.

9.      Outlier Detection: Use the median and interquartile range (IQR) to detect outliers in 'price,' 'quantity,' and 'revenue.' Values significantly outside the IQR may be considered outliers.

10.  Frequency Distributions: Create frequency distributions for 'price,' 'quantity,' and 'revenue' to understand the distribution of values within each variable.
