Classification Algorithms - Implement k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification using R

 

1.     Install and load necessary packages  (caret, e1071)

2.     Load iris dataset

3.     Explore the dataset

4.     Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets

5.     Build a K-Nearest Neighbor  model with K=3

6.     Make predictions on the test set

7.     Print the evaluation metrics.

8. Construct the model for values of k equal to 5, 7, and 9. Create a table displaying the corresponding accuracy values and identify the optimized k value.
