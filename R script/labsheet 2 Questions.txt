a.	Vectors: creating, indexing, and operations

 

1.  	Create a numeric vector containing the 10 elements and display the same.

2.  	Given a numeric vector, extract and print the values at even-numbered indices.

3.  	Take two numeric vectors of the same length and perform element-wise addition and subtraction.

4.  	Calculate the mean and median of a numeric vector containing test scores.

 

b.        Matrices and arrays

1.  	Perform Matrix addition and subtraction using R Programming.

2.  	Write a program to create a 2D array with random integers and display it.

3.  	Write a program to access and print specific elements, rows, and columns of a 2D array.

4.  	Calculate and display the mean, median, and standard deviation of a 2D array.

 

c.         Lists

1.  	Create a program that constructs a list with elements of different data types (numeric, character, logical).

2.  	Write a program that accesses and prints specific element of a list.

3.  	Create a program that calculates the length of a list and displays it.

 

d.        Character vectors

 

1.  	Create a program that constructs a character vector from a sequence of strings.

2.  	Write a program to find and display the length of a character vector.

3.  	Develop a program to check if a specific value exists in a character vector.
