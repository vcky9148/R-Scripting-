Multiple regression model

Implement the multiple regression model for the given dataset

 

1.     Install and load necessary packages  (caret, e1071)

2.     Load mtcars dataset

3.     Explore the dataset

4.     Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets

5.     Build a regression model to predict miles per gallon (`mpg`) based on multiple features such as weight (wt), horsepower (hp) and the number of cylinders (cyl).

6.     Make predictions on the test set

7.     Find MSE and RMSE

8.     Evaluate the model

9.     Print the evaluation metrics
